================

This repo and the branch gh-pages are supposed to be used for creating wiki pages for documenting metricsgreimoire and Vizgreimoire*.  New to git, so this may all be a wash.  I put the pages into the repo on the gh-pages branch, but I can't see them when I list the branch....

More as I learn more.
